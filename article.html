                            Since the introduction of Virtual Game, it has been achieving great heights so far as its popularity and technological advancement are concerned. The history of video game is as interesting as a fairy tale. The quality of today’s video game was not at
                            all there when video game first conceptualized and played ever. During the formulative years, video games were created by using various interactive electronic devices with various display formats. The first ever video game
                            was designed in 1947 by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. (Source: Wikipedia.org) The device was recognized as Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Device. From Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Device to Xbox 360, PlayStation series
                            or Nintendo WII, the story behind video games and accessories is really very creative and adventurous. Recently played video games are quite developed and they are more interactive than the earlier video games.

                            From analog video game design to 2D and 3D video games all have their own charm and video game lovers try to play all sorts of video games. In this respect our team talked to John, who lives in Sidney, Australia. When he was asked about his preference
                            about the type of video game, he replied, “Let me make it clear from the very beginning that I’m really crazy about video games. I’ve been playing video games since I gained consciousness…LOL…Really I’m serious. My father owns
                            a video game store here in Sidney and we are still managing the same store. The only difference that you may find is the shelves. The old analog video games were replaced by 2D and 3D video games. We have several regular customers
                            and they very often come to our store and ask for the LATEST. I too ask about their preference and they say they love to try any sort of video games.

                            What ever that is competitive, they love to play. So far playing excitement of video games is concerned, they can be compared with the soccer match between Manchester United and Liverpool.” It’s not the quality of video games that improves, researches
                            and developments are too evident in video game accessories, too. Without such accessories, the real excitement of video games can not be enjoyed. It’s pretty easy to recognize video game accessories.
